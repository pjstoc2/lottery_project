# Lottery Data Analysis

## Overview
This project analyzes lottery data to determine randomness using Chi-square tests and visualizations.

## Structure
- `data/`: Contains the datasets used for analysis.
- `scripts/`: Python scripts and notebooks for scraping, cleaning, and analyzing the data.
- `visualizations/`: Contains the resulting charts and graphs from the analysis.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- numpy, scipy, matplotlib, pandas

## Running the Code
1. Clone the repository.
2. Install dependencies with `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Run the analysis script with `python scripts/analysis.py`.

## Results
The analysis shows deviations in certain lottery numbers, but statistical tests confirm overall randomness.
